### Experience

- **Quantive  - ML - II Engineer**  
*June '22 - May '23 (1 yr)*  
    - Led a team of 3 ML Engineers, formulated solutions and designed experiments for team.
    - Developed LLM-powered agents to create API endpoints and SQL queries for natural language queries, enabling a centralized q&a dashboard.
    - Primary Contributor in building an *automated - online - unsupervised* Anomaly Detection & Forecasting engine for the company's Business Monitoring Platform for real-time streaming time-series data with the following key capabilities:
        - Probabilistic Forecasting based on [DeepAR](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.04110.pdf) & [N-Beats](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10437).
        - Handle time-series following multiple distributions s.a. Gaussian, Discrete & Negative Binomial.
        - Developed a novel normalization strategy for online training of non-stationary time-series.
        - Developed a relative anomaly scoring mechanism, to minimize anomaly alert storms.
        - Seasonality, Trend & Changepoint Detection amongst other auxiliary features.

- **Cliff.ai (acquired by Quantive) - ML - I Engineer**  
*May '20 - May '22 (2 yrs)*  
    - Developed multi-modal metric learning models for product matching using images, text & breadcrumbs.
    - Developed a Knowlegde Graph of business metrics based on associated metadata, synchronicity of anomalies & seasonal patterns for serving multiple downstream tasks.
    - Developed multiple solutions for Multi-Dimensional Temporal Data.
        - Automatic EDA engine for surfacing insights from inspired by [Microsoft's MetaInsight](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/metainsight-automatic-discovery-of-structured-knowledge-for-exploratory-data-analysis/)
        - Contributed to RnD of Root Cause Analysis for surfacing explainable dimensions to explain change.
        - Capability to generate explainable targetted forecasts to foresee dimensional distribution of KPIs.

- **Ribbon Communications - QA Engineer**  
*Aug '18 - Dec '19 (1 yr 5 mo)*  
    - Contributed to testing focusing around high availability (HA) reliability, certificate management, cloud deployment, and stress testing of Session Border Controllers.
    - Developed and implemented automation tools to streamline manual tasks for the QA team.
